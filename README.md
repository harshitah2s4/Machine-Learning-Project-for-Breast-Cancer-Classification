Steps Followed-

Importing the required Dependencies-
Importing all the required libraries for our model.

Data Collection and Pre-processing- 
We have loaded the dataset from sklearn library and then we have loaded the data into the dataframe.

Separating the features and data-
We get the insight all the parameters are slightly higher for malignant than benign cases.

Splitting the data into training data & Testing data-
Here we have splitted the x and y values

Model Evaluation-
In the model training step weâ€™ll use logistic regression which is very useful for binary classification of our two classes-benign and malignant.

Building a Predictive System-
This is the last step . This gives the result whether the tumour is benign or malignant.
